# Changelog

In reverse chronological order.

## [v0.1](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/compare/c1d31f976d95f2a56a494b2856268b97c3a84d05..v0.1?diff=split) (<small>2025-02-12</small>)

### <small>[`25c90e2`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/25c90e2a6b7d8186315a6bae9c62ed7dc797dcf0)</small> Released v0.1

Awaiting feedback and review.

### <small>[`c5b2f1b`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/c5b2f1ba84aa1bbc995fb0bfbebb118d7ea166ed)</small> Changed "Compatibility clause" to "Downstream clause" in Article 5

This should make it clear that it only applies to downstream compatibility.

### <small>[`152943e`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/152943eaece25b3c63f209598638d4586f72a63e)</small> Changed list of Compatible Licences

- Only allow XPL, GPL and AGPL (same or stronger copyleft)
- Specify "or later" (future-proofing)
- The last sentence is redundant for XPL

This removes the ability to downgrade to a weaker copyleft licence, while ensuring compatibility with future versions.

Note: This only applies to "downstream" compatibility, the "upstream" compatibility with other free/open source software licences remains the same.

### <small>[`ea5f7e8`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/ea5f7e89088e901bd7732433b024fdac1cf0893a)</small> Removed problematic exception in Article 8

The exception for "cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons" is ambiguous and problematic. Its interpretation can vary considerably by jurisdiction, making the extent of the exception uncertain. Instead, the following sentence has been appended: "This limitation of liability shall apply to the extent allowed by applicable law."

### <small>[`e2b8558`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/e2b8558ba58b228d1460b34806d7097aee7993b7)</small> Removed statutory product liability in Article 8

The sentence is redundant if such laws apply to the Work anyway. This change was made in the spirit of conciseness, it is not to say that the Licensor is exempt from such laws.

### <small>[`57dceac`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/57dceacc3449ad2dacf595f5e3530a2f71b97482)</small> Changed to gender neutral language

Nothing ideological about this, it just makes more sense.

### <small>[`4c59c3f`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/4c59c3f80db4bc81e333e2cf34cdc68955528e48)</small> Removed examples in Article 11

- The phrase "offering to download" is potentially ambiguous. Is the Licensor or the Licensee doing the downloading?
- The term "website" will confuse readers in the future. Try asking someone born this century if they know what a floppy disk is.

While the intentions behind these examples are good, they are likely to have the opposite effect in the future. Removing them also makes the text flow better.

### <small>[`02a6e47`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/02a6e47ba1e9bb36f4d7bfe6844e6c7049ac6554)</small> Fixed references to definitions

- Lowercase "distributes" and "communicates" is consistent with use elsewhere in the licence
- "Source Code", not "Source"
- "Licence", not "License"

### <small>[`76df109`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/76df109f5b8f61ffd4a60083f71d6686ed457f21)</small> Removed "The" from definitions

Makes it simpler and doesn't alter its meaning.

### <small>[`35b01e0`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/35b01e08e49ffd15ac6e834330d464af7c49aa62)</small> Removed assumption of a copyright notice

A copyright notice is not required by many jurisdictions.

### <small>[`de06b0b`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/de06b0b61846aa50df52a29d270fda9871cb59e1)</small> Removed all references to the EU


### <small>[`dfc3bec`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/dfc3bec17c965b6dcffb18834931cf2915d77b90)</small> Changed name to XPL


### <small>[`c1d31f9`](https://github.com/joakim/xpl/commit/c1d31f976d95f2a56a494b2856268b97c3a84d05)</small> Added original EUPL license
