# XPL (Extended Public Licence)

XPL is a friendly fork of the [European Union Public License](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/introduction-eupl-licence).

The EUPL is an excellent licence in many ways, but it has some unfortunate flaws.

- It is tailored to the EU and the needs of its public administrations (which is fine, but not applicable to most)
- It permits downgrading to weaker licences (which is not fine)
- It has an ambiguous and potentially problematic liability exception
- It expects a copyright notice to be attached to the work (not required in many jurisdictions)

XPL fixes these issues (and a few minor ones), resulting in a licence that is applicable to people worldwide and more compatible with free/libre software. It remains "moderately copyleft" and compatible with most popular open source licenses.
